## Theory
Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a simplified form of context-free grammars where all production rules follow specific patterns. It's named after Noam Chomsky, who introduced the concept in formal language theory. A grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form if every production rule is in one of these forms:

1. A → BC (where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols)
2. A → a (where A is a non-terminal symbol and a is a terminal symbol)
3. S → ε (where S is the start symbol and ε represents the empty string)

The third rule is only allowed if the start symbol S doesn't appear on the right side of any production.

Transforming a grammar into CNF simplifies many algorithms in formal language theory, particularly the CYK (Cocke-Younger-Kasami) algorithm for parsing context-free languages.

## Objectives:
1. Understand the concept of Chomsky Normal Form and its significance in formal language theory
2. Learn the process of transforming a context-free grammar into CNF
3. Implement a method for normalizing an input grammar by the rules of CNF
4. Test the implementation with various grammars

## Implementation Description

### Conversion to Chomsky Normal Form
The conversion process involves several steps:

1. Create a new start symbol if necessary (if the original start symbol appears on the right side of any production)
2. Eliminate empty productions (ε-productions)
3. Eliminate unit productions (A → B where B is a non-terminal)
4. Eliminate inaccessible symbols (symbols that cannot be reached from the start symbol)
5. Eliminate non-productive symbols (symbols that cannot derive any terminal string)
6. Convert long productions to binary form (A → X₁X₂...Xₙ to a set of binary productions)
7. Convert terminal productions in long rules (ensure terminals only appear in productions of form A → a)

### Creating a New Start Symbol
This method first checks if the original start symbol appears on the right-hand side of any production rule. If it does, a new start symbol (typically the original symbol with an apostrophe) is created to maintain CNF requirements. This is an important first step because in CNF, if we allow S → ε, then S cannot appear on the right side of any production. Creating a new start symbol S' with the rule S' → S ensures this constraint is satisfied while preserving the language generated by the grammar.
```python
def convert_to_chomsky_form(self):
    # Check if start symbol appears on the right side of any production
    new_start_needed = False
    for nt, prods in self.productions.items():
        for prod in prods:
            if self.start_symbol in prod:
                new_start_needed = True
                break
    
    # Create new start symbol if needed
    if new_start_needed:
        new_start = f"{self.start_symbol}'"
        self.non_terminals.add(new_start)
        self.productions[new_start] = [self.start_symbol]
        self.start_symbol = new_start
```
### Eliminating Empty Productions
This step removes all ε-productions (rules that produce the empty string) except potentially one for the start symbol. The algorithm first identifies all "nullable" non-terminals—those that can derive the empty string either directly or indirectly. Then, for each production containing nullable symbols, it creates new productions that account for those symbols potentially being empty. This is done by generating all possible combinations where nullable symbols are either kept or removed. For example, if A → BCD and B and D are nullable, we add productions A → BCD, A → BC, A → CD, and A → C. This preserves the language while eliminating direct ε-productions.
```python
def eliminate_empty_productions(self):
    # Find all nullable non-terminals (symbols that can derive epsilon)
    N_lambda = set()
    for nt, prods in self.productions.items():
        if "epsilon" in prods:
            N_lambda.add(nt)
            
    # Iteratively find all nullable symbols
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        for nt, prods in self.productions.items():
            if nt in N_lambda:
                continue
            for prod in prods:
                if all(symbol in N_lambda for symbol in prod):
                    N_lambda.add(nt)
                    changed = True
                    break
    
    # Create new productions that account for nullable symbols
    for nt, prods in self.productions.items():
        for prod in prods:
            if prod == "epsilon":
                continue
                
            # Generate all possible versions of the production by removing nullable symbols
            nullable_positions = [i for i, symbol in enumerate(prod) if symbol in N_lambda]
            for subset in powerset(nullable_positions):
                new_prod = "".join(symbol for i, symbol in enumerate(prod) if i not in subset)
                if new_prod and new_prod not in new_productions[nt]:
                    new_productions[nt].append(new_prod)
```
### Eliminating Unit Productions
This method eliminates unit productions (A → B where B is a non-terminal) by computing the transitive closure of unit derivations and replacing them with direct derivations. The algorithm first finds all pairs (A, B) such that A can derive B through a sequence of unit productions (this is called a "unit pair"). Then, for each such pair, it replaces the unit production A → B with all the non-unit productions of B. This preserves the language while ensuring no unit productions remain in the grammar. This step is essential because CNF only allows productions with exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right side.
```python
def eliminate_unit_productions(self):
    # Find all unit pairs (A ⇒* B) using transitive closure
    unit_pairs = {nt: {nt} for nt in self.non_terminals}
    
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        for a in self.non_terminals:
            for prod in self.productions.get(a, []):
                if prod in self.non_terminals:  # This is a unit production A → B
                    for b in unit_pairs.get(prod, set()):
                        if b not in unit_pairs[a]:
                            unit_pairs[a].add(b)
                            changed = True
    
    # Replace unit productions with their derivations
    new_productions = {nt: [] for nt in self.non_terminals}
    for a in self.non_terminals:
        for b in unit_pairs[a]:  # For each B where A ⇒* B
            for prod in self.productions.get(b, []):
                # Only add non-unit productions
                if prod not in self.non_terminals and prod not in new_productions[a]:
                    new_productions[a].append(prod)
```
### Eliminating Inaccessible Symbols
This step removes all symbols that cannot be reached from the start symbol. Using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, it identifies all "accessible" symbols—those that can be derived from the start symbol through a sequence of production rules. Any non-terminal that isn't accessible is removed from the grammar along with its productions. This step simplifies the grammar without changing the language it generates, since inaccessible symbols by definition cannot contribute to any string in the language.
```python
def eliminate_inaccessible_symbols(self):
    # Find all accessible symbols starting from the start symbol using BFS
    accessible = {self.start_symbol}
    queue = [self.start_symbol]

    while queue:
        current = queue.pop(0)
        for prod in self.productions.get(current, []):
            for symbol in prod:
                if symbol in self.non_terminals and symbol not in accessible:
                    accessible.add(symbol)
                    queue.append(symbol)
    
    # Remove inaccessible symbols and their productions
    new_non_terminals = {nt for nt in self.non_terminals if nt in accessible}
    new_productions = {}
    for nt in new_non_terminals:
        new_productions[nt] = self.productions[nt]
```
### Eliminating Non-productive Symbols
This method converts all productions with more than two symbols on the right side to binary form (with exactly two symbols). For a long production like A → X₁X₂...Xₙ, it introduces new non-terminals Y₁, Y₂, etc., and creates a series of binary productions: A → X₁Y₁, Y₁ → X₂Y₂, ..., Yₙ₋₂ → Xₙ₋₁Xₙ. This transformation is necessary to satisfy the CNF requirement that non-terminal productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the right side. The new grammar generates the same language as the original while adhering to this constraint.
```python
def convert_long_productions(self):
    new_productions = {}
    new_non_terminals = set(self.non_terminals)
    next_nt_index = 1

    for nt, prods in self.productions.items():
        new_productions[nt] = []

        for prod in prods:
            if len(prod) <= 2:  # Already in correct form
                new_productions[nt].append(prod)
            else:  # Need to break down
                symbols = list(prod)
                current_nt = nt
                
                # Convert A → X₁X₂...Xₙ to A → X₁Y₁, Y₁ → X₂Y₂, ..., Yₙ₋₂ → Xₙ₋₁Xₙ
                while len(symbols) > 2:
                    first = symbols.pop(0)
                    new_nt = f"Y{next_nt_index}"
                    next_nt_index += 1
                    new_non_terminals.add(new_nt)
                    new_productions.setdefault(current_nt, []).append(first + new_nt)
                    current_nt = new_nt
                
                # Add the final production with the last two symbols
                new_productions.setdefault(current_nt, []).append("".join(symbols))
```
### Converting Long Productions
This final step ensures that terminals only appear in productions of the form A → a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. For each terminal in the grammar, it creates a new non-terminal (typically named X_a for terminal a) with the production X_a → a. Then, in any production with more than one symbol on the right side, all terminals are replaced with their corresponding non-terminal substitutes. This ensures that the resulting grammar follows the CNF requirement that terminals can only appear alone on the right side of a production. The transformation preserves the language while satisfying this constraint.
```python
def convert_terminal_productions(self):
    new_productions = {}
    new_non_terminals = set(self.non_terminals)
    terminal_nts = {}  # Maps terminals to their non-terminal substitutes

    # Create a new non-terminal for each terminal
    for terminal in self.terminals:
        terminal_nt = f"X_{terminal}"
        new_non_terminals.add(terminal_nt)
        new_productions[terminal_nt] = [terminal]
        terminal_nts[terminal] = terminal_nt

    # Replace terminals in multi-symbol productions
    for nt, prods in self.productions.items():
        new_productions.setdefault(nt, [])
        for prod in prods:
            if len(prod) == 1:  # Keep single-symbol productions unchanged
                new_productions[nt].append(prod)
            else:  # Replace terminals in longer productions
                new_prod = ""
                for symbol in prod:
                    if symbol in self.terminals:
                        new_prod += terminal_nts[symbol]  # Use the non-terminal substitute
                    else:
                        new_prod += symbol
                new_productions[nt].append(new_prod)
```
### Converting Terminal Productions
This step ensures that terminals only appear in productions of the form A → a by introducing new non-terminals for terminals in longer productions.
```python
def convert_terminal_productions(self):
    new_productions = {}
    new_non_terminals = set(self.non_terminals)
    terminal_nts = {}

    for terminal in self.terminals:
        terminal_nt = f"X_{terminal}"
        new_non_terminals.add(terminal_nt)
        new_productions[terminal_nt] = [terminal]
        terminal_nts[terminal] = terminal_nt

    for nt, prods in self.productions.items():
        new_productions.setdefault(nt, [])

        for prod in prods:
            if len(prod) == 1:
                new_productions[nt].append(prod)
            else:
                new_prod = ""
                for symbol in prod:
                    if symbol in self.terminals:
                        new_prod += terminal_nts[symbol]
                    else:
                        new_prod += symbol
                new_productions[nt].append(new_prod)

    self.non_terminals = new_non_terminals
    self.productions = new_productions
    return self
```
### Complete Conversion Process
The complete conversion process is orchestrated by the convert_to_chomsky_form method, which calls each of the above methods in sequence:
```python
def convert_to_chomsky_form(self):
    print("Eliminating empty productions...")
    self.eliminate_empty_productions()
    print("Empty productions eliminated.")

    print("Eliminating unit productions...")
    self.eliminate_unit_productions()
    print("Unit productions eliminated.")

    print("Eliminating inaccessible symbols...")
    self.eliminate_inaccessible_symbols()
    print("Inaccessible symbols eliminated.")

    print("Eliminating non-productive symbols...")
    self.eliminate_non_productive_symbols()
    print("Non-productive symbols eliminated.")

    print("Converting long productions to binary...")
    self.convert_long_productions()
    print("Long productions converted.")

    print("Converting terminals in productions with length > 1...")
    self.convert_terminal_productions()
    print("Terminal productions converted.")

    print("Conversion to Chomsky Normal Form completed.\n")
    print(self.productions)
    return self
```
### Results
To test the Chomsky Normal Form conversion algorithm, I used the following grammar:
```python
grammar = Grammar.Grammar({"S", "A", "B", "C", "E"}, {"a", "b"}, {
    'S': ['aB', 'AC'],
    'A': ['a', 'ASC', 'BC'],
    'B': ['b', 'bS'],
    'C': ['epsilon', 'BA'],
    'E': ['bB'],
}, "S")
```
This is a context-free grammar with:

Non-terminals: S, A, B, C, E

Terminals: a, b

Start symbol: S

Productions:

S → aB | AC

A → a | ASC | BC

B → b | bS

C → ε | BA

E → bB

After running the conversion algorithm, the grammar is transformed into Chomsky Normal Form. Here's the process and result:

```
## Conclusion
This laboratory work provided an in-depth exploration of Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and its pivotal role in formal language theory. The systematic transformation of a context-free grammar into CNF was meticulously implemented, encompassing the elimination of ε-productions, unit productions, inaccessible and non-productive symbols, as well as the conversion of long and terminal-inclusive productions into the required binary forms.​

The implementation was rigorously tested on a complex grammar, demonstrating the algorithm's robustness and accuracy. 

This exercise not only reinforced theoretical concepts but also enhanced practical skills in algorithm development and formal grammar manipulation. The successful conversion and validation of the grammar underscore the effectiveness of the implemented methods and their applicability in computational linguistics and language processing tasks.
